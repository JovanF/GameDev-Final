# GameDev-Final
A repo for the final project for my Game Development course Fall 23

## Problems:
1. **Jumping** `implemented with a ray cast but not working`
2. **Spawning** `The branches spawn until the original prefabs get destroyed and then they stop because they have no references`
3. **Scenes** `There are no scenes. Need to make one for game start and game end -> retry/quit.`



## Solved
1. fixed the spawning by adding in weights to the random decisions.
2. fixed jumping by adding a boolean that reset upon landing.
